Repository hosting project deliveries developed on the curricular unit of *Analysis and Conception of Algorithms*, at FEUP.


### Road Evacuation System
Implementation of path-finding algorithms on graphs in order to enable traffic deviation in case of an emergency, while mantaining its flow and avoiding jams:
- **Djikstra**'s algorithm
- **A*** algorithm

Implementation of string-matching algorithms in order to recognize road names inserted by the user:
- **Exact** string matching (**Knuth-Morris-Pratt** algorithm)
- **Approximate** string matching (using the edit distance concept between strings)
